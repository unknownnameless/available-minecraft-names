# Available Username Lists

I prefer usernames that are one word with no symbols or numbers, so I parsed some lists of english words for available minecraft usernames

this included a 300k long list of english words (completely unnecessary, resulted in 200k words available as usernames)

but there are also some more usefull lists made including hand sorted lists

archived because it was a lot of work work done on Jan 25 2024, not updated past that date

(be aware there are a lot of offensive and curse words in some of the lists because the raw lists I downloaded contained offensive words and the method of username checking did not differentiate whether the words were banned or not)

imo these are the best available usernames rn

# Available Username Lists Minecraft Java

I wanted a new username... If anyone else wants to try some of these usernames or use them for inspiration it would make the amount of work I put into this just to choose my own username more worthwhile 

I prefer usernames that are one word with no symbols or numbers, shorter the better. It is quite hard to get good and especially short words anymore with A. the amount of players and B. username sniping and bots, so I parsed some lists of english words for available minecraft usernames.

this included a 300k long list of english words (completely unnecessary, resulted in 200k words available as usernames)

but there are also some more usefull lists made including filtered for popularity and then handsorted popular words

archived for my sake, work done on Jan 25 2024, not updated past that date

(be aware there are a lot of offensive and curse words randomly dispersed in some of the lists because the raw lists and offensive words are popular words and in a lot of data sources I downloaded contained offensive words and the method of username checking did not differentiate whether the words were banned or not)

this is the best list to glance thru [Hand Sorted Lists/S_Tier.txt](https://github.com/unknownnameless/available-minecraft-names/blob/master/Hand%20Sorted%20Lists/S_Tier.txt)

lists are randomized because on the lists like the 200k long one I wanted to be able to glance thru and have random chance of finding good words instead of useless alphabetized lists where all I can see is As for 25,000 lines
